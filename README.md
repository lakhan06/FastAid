Difficulty finding the right hospital: Depending on the severity of their condition, a person may need to go to a specific type of hospital (e.g. a trauma center for a serious injury) or one that is located close to their home. Without the right information or resources, it can be difficult for people to find the hospital that is best suited to their needs.

Inefficient use of time: If a person goes to the wrong hospital or spends a long time waiting at the ED or in finding the appropriate hospital, they may be using up valuable time that could be better spent getting the medical care they need.

Long wait times at emergency departments: In some cases, people may need to go to the emergency department (ED) for urgent care. However, EDs can be very busy and have long wait times, which can be stressful and potentially harmful for people who are in need of immediate medical attention.

By providing information on the location and severity of the patient, the project could help people find the right hospital for their needs more quickly and efficiently. This could potentially save critical time for people who are in urgent need of medical care.
